## Important note

This is a collection of tiles we re-use for our own OSS projects. It is [not encouraged](https://github.com/repaint-io/maven-tiles#final-notes) to just use these tiles yourselves:

> Tiles-Maven works best when you and your team own the tiles. I donâ€™t recommend relying on open source tiles, always create your own versions and always lock down versions of third party tiles, just like you would third party dependencies.

That being said ... let's have some fun with tiles.
